      Howdy! My name is liu zhuo ren and I am a software engineering graduate from china University </a>. Currently still job hunting, hard times ðŸ˜ž.

      So I set off on this weird path because I became addicted to programming after taking an introductory programming course during my college years. Since then programming became my hobby and I took quite a few programming electives while I was busy dealing with thermodynamics and P&IDs in UQ. Too bad there was no dual major in chemical and software engineering at that time.

      Personally I like to think that I live in the console, more of a back end guy. I prefer writing command line programs because it is much faster to hack up and use. Frankly speaking, a lot of my motivation comes from being lazy (see <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" target="_blank">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a>, I highly recommend it).
